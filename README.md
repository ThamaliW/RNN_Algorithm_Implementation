# RNN_Algorithm_Implementation
Currently we are working on a project to add Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) algorithm to machine learner. RNN is one of deep learning algorithms with record breaking accuracy. For more information on RNN please refer link[1].

We have decided to use deeplearning4j which is an open source deep learning library scalable on spark and Hadoop.

Since there is a plan to add spark pipeline to machine Learner, we have decided to use spark pipeline concept to our project.

I have designed an architecture for the RNN implementation.
